# Lesson 3 Step 3: Making the Video Component
In the last step, we created the base for the Video() component, and in this one, we are going to flesh it out.
There is more complicated code for this one, so I will try to keep this README updated with it, but it is probably best to reference the actual code in this repository to follow along if you get stuck.       

There is a lot of code changes in this, and there is too much to put in this README to make this meaningful, so I will describe the overall process.    

There is also a lot of CSS (styling) updates, so you can just copy and paste the files from this repo if you are following along.       

I will describe the process you can follow and try my best to make it comprehensive.

## Goal of this step
We want to make a component that resembles a video on the homepage of youtube.      
To be honest, alot of getting it to look a certain way is done through CSS, and that is something that does not have much to do with React. Because of this, I am going to skip most of it for the sake of staying on topic.      

We will have a component that looks like a youtube video
